# Noteplan Date Modified Plugin

A NotePlan plugin that automatically renames a note to include the date of the time we last worked with it. So,  if a note is in `00 - Inbox` and we move it to `01 - Next Actions`, then we could use this plugin to rename the Note to include the current date so its clear when we last touched this. Ideally, the plugin would also add to a `Changelog` in the file (perhaps at the bottom, somewhere)
